- **Day 3-4**: 
   - Practice basic commands on [HackerRank Bash Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell).
   - Complete the first 2-3 exercises on [Exercism Bash Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash).

- **Day 5**: 
   - Read *The Linux Command Line* Chapters 7-12 (I/O redirection, filters).
   - Experiment with basic shell scripts (simple loops, conditionals).

### **Week 2: Basic Scripting and I/O Operations**
- **Day 1-2**: 
   - Study *The Linux Command Line* Chapters 13-17 (basic shell scripting).
   - Begin working through [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) sections 1-3 (intro to scripting concepts).

- **Day 3-4**: 
   - Write scripts handling user input and file operations.
   - Practice with intermediate-level [HackerRank challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell).

- **Day 5**: 
   - Continue solving more exercises on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash).
   - Focus on basic automation tasks like renaming files or backing up directories.

### **Week 3: Functions, Variables, and Error Handling**
- **Day 1-2**: 
   - Study advanced functions and variables from *Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide* (sections on arrays, functions, and variable scoping).
   - Write scripts using functions and variables.

- **Day 3-4**: 
   - Work on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash) exercises focusing on functions and error handling.
   - Implement basic error checking in your scripts (exit codes, try-catch logic).

- **Day 5**: 
   - Complete more intermediate and advanced challenges on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell) focused on these topics.
   - Write a script to automate a repetitive task using loops, conditionals, and error checking.

### **Week 4: File Handling and Advanced Operations**
- **Day 1-2**: 
   - Read sections on file handling and advanced scripting from *The Linux Command Line* (Chapter 18 onward).
   - Study advanced topics in [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide] (loops, traps, file descriptors).

- **Day 3-4**: 
   - Implement scripts for log analysis, file monitoring, or file manipulation.
   - Continue exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash) that emphasize file handling.

- **Day 5**: 
   - Solve advanced [HackerRank challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell) related to file operations, data processing.

### **Week 5: Scripting Best Practices and Optimization**
- **Day 1-2**: 
   - Study best practices in scripting from *Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide* (sections on optimization and security).
   - Work on improving the efficiency and readability of your scripts (commenting, modularization).

- **Day 3-4**: 
   - Read about debugging techniques and performance optimization in *The Linux Command Line*.
   - Apply performance optimization techniques (e.g., parallel processing, avoiding subshells).

- **Day 5**: 
   - Implement optimized scripts for real-world tasks (e.g., automating backups, system maintenance tasks).
   - Explore [StackOverflow Bash Tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/bash/info) for community tips and common issues.

### **Week 6: Real-World Projects and Final Review**
- **Day 1-2**: 
   - Work on a project that involves automating a significant task, such as monitoring system performance or managing files across directories.
   - Review lessons from *The Linux Command Line* and *Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide* to consolidate your knowledge.

- **Day 3-4**: 
   - Finalize scripts with a focus on modularization, optimization, and security.
   - Solve remaining advanced exercises on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell).

- **Day 5**: 
   - Test and review all the scripts you’ve created. Look for improvements and evaluate the project you’ve completed.
   - Final reflection on your progress: Consider starting a personal repository for your Bash scripts to keep refining and showcasing them.
